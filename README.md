# 360-Degree Customer View
The purpose of the „360-degree customer view“ is to facilitate the bank operations with individuals. It represents an idea that enables banks to have a complete overview of clients by showing in one place all relevant information about an individual, which is collected from several different channels.
This system allows the bank to distinguish itself from other banks through the quality of its relationship to customer, which leads to better customer analysis and helps increase sales.
The idea for developing this type of application was created during my employment in Sberbank BH d.d. Sarajevo.


# Deployment
MEAN stack is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for MongoDB, Express, Node.js and AngularJS based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.
